# GraphingData
Things to do:
    * add log and try to see if there are any memory leaks
    * add a way to average when data gets too large
    * add a 24hr view toggle 
    * try and fix the problems with not getting all of the data
    * there are a few bugs with large time periods but they are hard to know 
     what is going on
